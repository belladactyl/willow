# **Willow-Banner**

[Demo](http://codepen.io/team/UnumUX/pen/YZNzQM)

A banner is a highlighted area of a page used to call out a single piece of information or action. This area is typically styled to stand out visually from the rest of the pageâ€™s content and can contain a concise heading, sentence and action component such as a [willow-button](../button).

A banner either spans the width of the [willow-page-content](../page-content) component or the full width of the screen/viewport. It cannot contain multiple columns. The banner component can have a background image set by the developer. If one is not set a fallback color will be displayed.
